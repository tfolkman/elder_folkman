Dear Brother and Sister Folkman,

Sister Christensen and I wanted to let you know that your son, Elder Folkman, has arrived safely at the Arizona Tempe Mission Home. Attached you will find two photos that we thought you might enjoy. One is your missionary with Sister Christensen and me and the other is with the group of missionaries that arrived with him.

We are so pleased to have Elder Folkman serving in the Arizona Tempe Mission. Monday is Preparation Day at which time he will let you know his mailing address, the Zone and District to which he is assigned, and the name of his Trainer.

As we met with Elder Folkman we stressed the principles of obedience, hard work and worthiness.  This mission holds great potential for each missionary assigned.  The members are strong and love these great Elders and Sisters.  You can be assured they, and we, will do all possible to watch over your son.  It is a very special responsibility we feel toward our missionaries.  We want to see them enjoy a happy and successful mission.

Our missionaries have permission to Skype or telephone their families twice per year: on Mothersâ€™ Day and at Christmas.  But if you need to get a message to your son, or if you have any questions, please call us directly (480-838-0659).  We do want the missionaries to receive letters and e-mails from home on a regular basis, encouraging them in their proselyting efforts.

Thank you for raising a son who has a desire to serve the Lord.
